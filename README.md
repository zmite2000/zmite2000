## About me 👋

⭐ I'm a **Reliability Engineer** by profession and a **Mathematician** at my core. For the last 20+ years my career has taken me on a journey through land, air, sea and space products. Assessing hardware and software products for their inherent availability and operational availability through the lifecycle process. The knowledge gained through lessons learned along the way have positioned me as a valuable asset to several teams and companies taking on the challenges of scaling manufacturing throughput, improve uptime, extend useful life, predictive analytics and more.

⭐ A fun fact about me is I designed wedding gowns and veils to help pay for a technical degree! This all started because my sister needed a prom dress and I needed to pay a rather high phone bill to our Dad. He agreed to absolve me of my bill if I could make my sister's dream dress. How hard could it be? I was up for the challenge. It was hard. But, I discovered my approach to solving challenges that has served me well over the years. Plus, my sister got her dream prom dress. Win-win.
